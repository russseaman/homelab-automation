# Homelab Automation
This is a repository setup to manage my homelab and any stacks I use.  I will try to include any Diagrams/Tech Stack/code(IAC or psuedo) to make it as easy as possible to understand/follow as possible

Please let me know tips/advice/what you would like to see along my journey.

## Hardware Overview
### Network
* UDM-Pro (Router/Firewall)
* 

## Tech Stack
This will be broken down into several different tech stacks depending on use case, please note that these will change as my homelab is a place of learning, so things will break/change often

### Stack is managed by Terraform (Hashicorp

### Hashi Stack (Hashicorp)
* Consul
* Nomad
* Vault
